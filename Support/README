What is this?

Smartest is an open-source online publishing platform developed and distributed by VSC Labs (http://www.vsclabs.com/).

Like a Wordpress blog, Smartest is a SERVER application that runs centrally and is accessible from everywhere; it will not run as an application on your Mac or PC as Word or Photoshop would.
