Installing Smartest is very simple.

1) Create an empty database, and a user that has permission to create tables there.
2) ./Public/index.php will handle the rest. Either just go to it, or better still give the ./Public/ dir its own hostname.
3) There's no step three

Note: Smartest is still currently dependent on Apache's mod_rewrite functionality, or equivalent; all requests to Smartest must go through a single entry point - ./Public/index.php, regardless of the URL.
