projects can justify the volumes required.  Elixent's D-Fabrix
Reconfigurable Algorithm Processor (RAP) addresses this problem.  D-Fabrix users can create a single device that implements many
functions, re-using the silicon over and over for different purposes.
The virtual hardware thus created has hardware performance, with
software flexibility.  Supplied as IP, it is revolutionising the market
in high-volume markets like multimedia & wireless.  Users reap benefits
in reduced development costs and time to market, often with reduced
silicon cost.","http://www.elixent.com","","",85110105116125,"United States of America",11/10/2000
