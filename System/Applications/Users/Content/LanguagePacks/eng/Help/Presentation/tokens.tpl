<p>Permission tokens are the system within Smartest that allows the administrator to decide exactly what type of action each user is allowed to carry out.</p>
<p>For example, a user can only publish a page if they have the 'publish_approved_pages' or 'publish_all_pages' tokens. Likewise a user can only delete files from the repository if they have the 'delete_assets' token.</p>
<p>Granting new tokens to users can be done by anybody who has the 'modify_user_permissions' token or the 'root_permission' token.</p>
<p>The 'root_permission' token is equivalent to having all other tokens granted.</p>
