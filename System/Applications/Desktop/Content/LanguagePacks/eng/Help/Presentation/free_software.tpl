<p>Smartest is <strong>Free Software</strong>. This is a concept, developed by Richard Stallman in around 1983, that the software you use must guarantee you four fundamental freedoms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The freedom to run the program for any purpose</li>
    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and modify it if you wish</li>
    <li>The freedom to redistribute copies of the program</li>
    <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all software conforms to this, and we'll let you make up your own mind about this idea, but you should know that that is what Smartest is.</p>

<p>As a practical consequence of being "Free," Smartest is also <strong>Open-Source</strong>.</p>
<p>The emphasis of open source, rather than being an ethical one, is one that says that <strong>all the users benefit</strong> if the code of their programs is visible, because - among other things - bugs and security vulnerabilities can be easily found and fixed.</p>
