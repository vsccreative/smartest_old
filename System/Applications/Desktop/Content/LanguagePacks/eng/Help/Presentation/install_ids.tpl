<p>We have big plans to create a suite of <strong>opt-in</strong> cloud-based services and benefits for all Smartest users. This will include content-sharing and distribution for those that want a larger audience.</p>
<p>With your permission, install and site IDs will be used to identify you in communications with us and that community - that's if you decide to join in.</p>
<p>Smartest is {help id="desktop:freesoftware"}Free Software{/help}, and wholly embraces the {help id="desktop:freesoftware"}four fundamental freedoms{/help} which that entails. No information about you, your content, or your web server - software or hardware - will ever be shared <strong>without your express consent</strong>. And this 'consent' won't be buried in terms and conditions either - you'll be told, like you deserve to be.</p>
<p>More details will be provided as completion of these features approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Install IDs</strong> are made of six pairs of characters, generated from a <strong>one-way hashing</strong> of near-unique attributes like your IP address and root directory, but these details are <strong>not calculable</strong> from your install ID.</p>
<p><strong>Site IDs</strong> are made of the install ID, plus two further pairs of digits, generated partly at random and partly from one-way hashing the site title.</p>
