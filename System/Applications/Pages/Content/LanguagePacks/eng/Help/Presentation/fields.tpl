<p>Fields are a feature of Smartest that allow small pieces of information on a web-page to be editable.</p>
<p>For example, each page on your site may have a theme or color associated with it - fields allow the user to easily input this information.</p>
<p>To create a field, put <code>&lt;?sm:field name="<em><strong>field_name</strong></em>":?&gt;</code> in a container or {help id="templates:master_templates"}master template{/help}.</p>
<p>The {help id="websitemanager:page_elements_tree"}page elements tree{/help} will ask you to give Smartest more information about the field, after which you will be able to start inserting values for it onto pages.</p>
