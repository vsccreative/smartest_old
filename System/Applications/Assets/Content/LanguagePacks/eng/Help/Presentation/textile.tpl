<p>Easy text files are a great alternative to ordinary HTML-based text files. They keep formatting very consistent, and are great if you're pasting your content from Microsoft Word or similar, as they strip out a lot of the gunk.</p>
<p>Easy Text files use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)" target="_blank">formatting style called <strong>Textile</strong></a>, which is really easy to use. No HTML is needed at all.</p>
<p><strong>New paragraphs</strong> are created simply by making a double line break. Hit return twice, and you've made a new paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>Headlines</strong> are made by starting a new line with h1, h2, etc, followed by a dot. So a line starting with 'h2. ' will create a second-level headline. Like new paragraphs, headlines should have an empty line below them.</p>
<p><strong>Bulleted lists</strong> are made by starting each line with and asterisk or star (*) followed by a space:<br /><br />
* One<br />
* Two<br />
* Three<br /><br />
creates a perfect bulleted list.</p>
